# VAriable seLection with mixtureS of modEls

With [Emilie Devijver](http://ama.liglab.fr/~devijver/).

Re-writing from [a similar project](https://github.com/yagu0/select) in MATLAB, which
corresponds to applied parts of the PhD thesis of Emilie.

This git repo uses [git-fat](https://github.com/jedbrown/git-fat) to store binary objects.
"git fat init && git fat pull" will get them.
